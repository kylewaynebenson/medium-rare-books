He was a faculty member at The Abraham Lincoln School for Social Sciences, the educational institution run by the Communist Party USA. Goldsholl carved out his niche with corporate identity programs, packaging, and animated commercials, and produced the Good Design Logo for the Merchandise Mart and the Museum of Modern Art in 1950."

Writing at the height of his career, Rand articulated in his slender volume the pioneering vision that all design should seamlessly integrate form and function. This facsimile edition preserves Rand's original 1947 essay with the adjustments he made to its text and imagery for a revised printing in 1970, and adds only an informative and inspiring new foreword by design luminary Michael Bierut. As relevant today as it was when first published, this classic treatise is an indispensable addition to the library of every designer. - summary: fun, eyeopening, classic"

The book was originally a fundamentally new attempt to provide a methodical approach to challenges of graphic design. Elements of image and form are analyzed and examined with regard to their inherent laws. The thoroughly revised edition of the 1965 design manual classic includes new sections that adapt his thoughts to contemporary technological uses. Especially in times of the return to clear and minimalistic geometric forms and patterns, his rich body of work serves as a perfect starting point for contemporary design practices."

A visually stunning book that spotlights the relatively unknown Carboni’s work in from the early 1930s through the late 1950s. This book is a valuable resource because it traces the development of one of Italy's finest modernists through tightly focused case studies of his publicity work for the emerging Italian mass media.  It is a true joy to see complete campaigns reproduced in full.
With an introduction by Gio Ponti."
