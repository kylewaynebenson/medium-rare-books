                  <div class="sp__1 sp__1-md sp__1-sm"></div>
                  <p>Our library began in early 2018 with the acquisition of a selection of rare books from <a href="https://www.grainedit.com/">Dave Cuzner</a>, Founder and Senior Editor at Grain Edit.</p>
                  <h3 class="h3">Why do we have our own library?</h3>
                  <p>We’re constantly bombarded by visual “inspiration”. It is overwhelming and difficult to critically assess what elements should and should not influence our work as designers. That inspired us to surface inspiration material that doesn’t exist anywhere online. These books were published decades ago and still strongly influence design today. We have access to that material.</p>
                  <p>The act of picking a book and absorbing it helps us slow down and form a thoughtful perspective on where design has been and how it can shape our current and future work. It acts as a counterbalance to so much of the trend-driven work that surrounds us.</p>

He was a faculty member at The Abraham Lincoln School for Social Sciences, the educational institution run by the Communist Party USA. Goldsholl carved out his niche with corporate identity programs, packaging, and animated commercials, and produced the Good Design Logo for the Merchandise Mart and the Museum of Modern Art in 1950.</span></a>

					    <span class="book-detail">One of the seminal texts of graphic design, Paul Rand's Thoughts on Design is now available for the first time since the 1970s. Writing at the height of his career, Rand articulated in his slender volume the pioneering vision that all design should seamlessly integrate form and function. This facsimile edition preserves Rand's original 1947 essay with the adjustments he made to its text and imagery for a revised printing in 1970, and adds only an informative and inspiring new foreword by design luminary Michael Bierut. As relevant today as it was when first published, this classic treatise is an indispensable addition to the library of every designer. - summary: fun, eyeopening, classic</span></a>

					    <span class="book-detail">Armin Hofmann’s richly varied work is recognized for its reliance on the fundamental elements of graphic form – point, line, and form. The book was originally a fundamentally new attempt to provide a methodical approach to challenges of graphic design. Elements of image and form are analyzed and examined with regard to their inherent laws. The thoroughly revised edition of the 1965 design manual classic includes new sections that adapt his thoughts to contemporary technological uses. Especially in times of the return to clear and minimalistic geometric forms and patterns, his rich body of work serves as a perfect starting point for contemporary design practices.</span></a>

					    <span class="book-detail">“To the almost unlimited and often unrealized potentialities of radio and television advertising, Erberto Carboni brings all the ingenuity and dramatic flair which have made him a brilliant leader in the exciting Italian school of modern design.”
A visually stunning book that spotlights the relatively unknown Carboni’s work in from the early 1930s through the late 1950s. This book is a valuable resource because it traces the development of one of Italy's finest modernists through tightly focused case studies of his publicity work for the emerging Italian mass media.  It is a true joy to see complete campaigns reproduced in full.
With an introduction by Gio Ponti.</span></a>

For over 30 years now, the American Illustration books are lavishly produced in large-format, hardcover print, the AI32 annual, based on the creative direction by Richard Turley. An image index includes the artist’s contact information, captions and creative credits listing the publications, schools, agencies and clients who commissioned and utilized the winning work.
Illustration, as a vital tool of communication and visual delight, continues to defy long-held and exaggerated reports of its own demise with artists taking bold risks and forging new markets with self-generated projects, all the while maintaining a healthy amount of traditional assignment work from publishers and advertising agencies.

                  <p>You got a good steak marinade recipe? "Sweet or Spicey" answers Justin Pervorse. IDK if you've ever been to E3 (the big video games expo) or seen any of the "prestige" keynotes that happen there, but it's `a lot`. Verrrry similar to tech events in their sometimes somber, always self-congratulatory grandeur. They're massive, expensive pressers that pitch their wares to the Gamers™ in a very "we get you" and "give the people what they want" sort of way.</p>
